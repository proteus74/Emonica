A Midi - Harmonica
Low at price and easy to build.

Some time ago I saw that in the early 80's there was a synthesizer that you could play like a harmonica.
The device called itself **Millioniser 2000** and could probably never prevail in the market. Today you can still buy this (used) devices  on Ebay at horrendous prices. Therefore, I decided to build a midi harmonica myself. Suitable for the Hackaday price.
